# CoopGo

This a simple website which I am writing. The purpose of this work is to implement basic CRUD functionality in such a way that the software can be used to lessen the demand placed on Homeschool Co-op administrators. Due to the nature of this problem (low user-count, medium complexity, no need for anything highly polished) I have decided to use Go (Echo specifically) for the Backend, HTMX for the frontend (I will probably have to resort to some inline js at some point), and Sqlite3 for the database (tried and true, and plenty fast for the low user counts I am dealing with).

I am planning on eventually turning this project into a small Saas product for local co-ops, thus the GNU license.
